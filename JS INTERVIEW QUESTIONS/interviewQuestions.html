    <h1> How do we link JS to HTML?</h1>
    <p>we use script tag in html file to link any external JS file. </p>
    
    
    <h1> How does script tag works?</h1>
    <p>script tag run javascript in HTML file. </p>
    
    
    <h1> What are external scripts?</h1>
    <p>external script is a external file that contain on code use to fatch that code in your main code. </p>
    
    
    <h1> How is innerHTML is different from document.write()? </h1>
    <p>we can change inner content of any element through innerHTML and document.write() is use to put the content directly in browser. </p>
    
    
    <h1> What are use cases for console.log()?</h1>
    <p>when we want get any output or message in browser console in that case we use console.log(). </p>
    
    
    <h1> what are veriables and how to declare veriables?</h1>
    <p>variabales are the basic unit of storage in programming and in javascript we can declare a veriable in 3 ways VAR LET & CONST after declaration veriable has no value technically its undefined. </p>
    
    
    <h1> What's the difference between let/const/var?</h1>
    <p>var  : we can re-assign value and redeclare to "var".<br>let  : we can re-assign value but can't redeclare to "let".<br>const: we can't re-assign value and can't redeclare to "const". </p>
    
    
    <h1> What do we mean by Arithmetics in JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>Arithmetics are branch of mathamatics and in javascript arithmetics use to get the numarical values from their operands an returned a single numarical value. </p>
    
    
    
    <h1> What is hoisting? Does declaring variable with let/const allow hoisting?</h1>
    <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution and the declaring variable with let and const allow hoisting but initialized. </p>
    
    
    <h1> How do we write JavaScript comments? What's the use case for comments? What role do they play in code documentation?</h1>
    <p>there are type of comment<br>1 single line comment : single line comment start from two forward slashes "//"
    <br>2 multiline comment : multi line start form "/*" and end with "*/" and we write comment between it.
    Comments in programming means adding explaination about source code how program is working.
    comment have not role its just use in documentation its make easy to re-read a program. </p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1> Write few basic arithmetic operators.</h1>
    <p>basic atithmetic operators are 
        <br>+ (addition), <br>- (subtraction), <br>* (multiplication),<br> / (division). </p>

    <h1> What are JavaScript primitives?</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object 
    and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:<br>
    
    string<br><br>
    number<br><br>
    bigint<br><br>
    boolean<br><br>
    undefined<br><br>
    symbol<br><br>
    null<br><br> </p>
    
    
    
    <h1> How do we differ between number, string and boolean?</h1>
    <p>Number always only digits<br>
    string always only sentence<br>
    booleab is peimitive that return only "true" & "false"<br> </p>
    
    
    <h1> What's the behavior of adding two strings?</h1>
    <p>to add two string we use concate() function. </p>
    
    
    
    <h1> Why do addition doesn't work between number and string?</h1>
    <p>addition is arithmatics operator that can only add two digits. </p>
    
    
    <h1> Why do you think we have objects and arrays?</h1>
    <p>object is use to put the data about a one specific , and arrays i use to put objects data. </p>
    
    
    <h1> What is mutation? Which JavaScript data types are immutable?</h1>
    <p>Mutation refers to changing the state or value of an existing variable or object. In JavaScript, some data types are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed after they are created.

        <br>The following JavaScript data types are immutable:
        
        <br>Numbers
        <br>Booleans
        <br>Null
        <br>Undefined
        <br>Symbols
        <br>On the other hand, the following JavaScript data types are mutable:
        
        <br>Objects
        <br>Arrays
        <br>Functions
        <br>When you modify an immutable value, a new value is created rather than modifying the existing one. This is important to keep in mind when working with JavaScript, as it can help you avoid unexpected changes to your code.
        </p>
    
    
    
    <h1> What is a function?</h1>
    <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.<br>
    </p>

    
    <h1> What are function arguments? </h1>
    <p>Function arguments, also known as parameters, are values that are passed into a function when it is called. These values can be used inside the function to perform some task or computation.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1>How many arguments can we receive from function?</h1>
    <p>There is no fixed limit to the number of arguments that you can pass to a function.</p>

    
    
    
    
    <h1> What's the importance of return statement?</h1>
    <p>A return statement ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function. Execution resumes in the calling function at the point immediately following the call. A return statement can return a value to the calling function.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1> What is a JavaScript event? Name few events.</h1>
    
    <p>In JavaScript, an event is a signal that is generated by the browser or the user<br>
        <br>Click event - triggered when an element is clicked.
        <br>Keydown event - triggered when a key is pressed down.
        <br>Mouseover event - triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
        <br>Scroll event - triggered when the user scrolls the page.
        <br>Submit event - triggered when a form is submitted.
        <br>Load event - triggered when the web page has finished loading.
        <br>Resize event - triggered when the window is resized.
    </p>
    
    
    <h1> Explain slice and substring method.</h1>
    <p>slice:<br>
    slice is methode that extract the string form "start point" to "before end" point.<br>
    substring:<br>
    substring is methode to extract the string from "after given point" to "before given point"
    </p>
    
    
    <h1>Can we modify the content of string to uppercase/lowercase?</h1>
    <p>yes we can modify the content to uppercase me use methode ".toLowerCase()" to lowercase we use methode ".toUpperCase()"</p>
    
    
    <h1> How to join two strings?</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, we can join two strings using the + operator or the concat() method.</p>
    
    
    <h1> Calculate how many words does this string have?</h1>
    <p>To calculate how many words a string has, we can split() methode that break string into separate arrays then  we can use .length() with split() to get the words in the string </p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1> What is NaN in JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>NaN stands for "Not a Number" in JavaScript, and it is a value of the Number data type. It is used to represent a value that is not a valid number.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h1> Can we access infinity in JavaScript? </h1>
    <p>yes we cam access infinity in javascript for e.g "console.log(1 / 0);"</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1> How can we convert string into number?</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, we can convert a string into a number using the parseInt() or parseFloat() functions.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1> What's a loop? Why do we need a loop?</h1>
    <p>A loop is a programming construct that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating over a collection of data, executing a set of instructions a certain number of times, or processing input data in batches.

        <br>In JavaScript, there are three types of loops: for, while, and do-while.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h1> Differentiate between some and every. Differentiate between forEach and map.</h1>
    <p>some and every are Array methods in JavaScript that are used to test the elements of an array.
    <br>in some() methode when one condition "matchs" and other are not match its return "ture"<br>
    The map() method is used to transform the elements of an array, whereas the forEach() method is used to loop through the elements of an array.<br> The map() method can be used with other array methods, such as the filter() method, <br>whereas the forEach() method cannot be used with other array methods.<br>
    but in every() methode its return "false" untill all conditions not match.</p>
